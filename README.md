Introduction

Inside Track is a step-counter app that lets you challenge your friends to races where the winner is determined by the greatest improvement over your average steps. You can run in multiple races at once that can last for minutes, hours, days, or a week -- all you have to do is log in, select your avatar, add your friends, and then you can hit the track.
